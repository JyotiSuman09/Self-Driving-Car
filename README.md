# Self Driving Car
## Neural Networks and Machine Learning

- No libraries only pure JS
- Implement simple physics to move the car
- Simulate sensors on the car, these sensors work by ray casting and detect whether the car which is close to the edge of road or to other cars in traffic
- Used mathematics formula for segment intersection
- Collision detection using same segment intersection formula
- Neural Network creation and visualization ; inspired by biological neural networks present in our brain
- Train and optimize the neural network by testing numerous test cars
- Used Genetic algorithms to train and optimism faster
