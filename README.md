# Self Driving Car
## Neural Networks and Machine Learning











- No libraries only pure JS
- Implement simple physics to move the car
- Simulate sensors on the car, these sensors work by ray casting and detect wheather the car which is close to the edge of road or to other cars in traffic
- Used mathematics formula for segment intersection
- Collision detection using same segement intersection formula
- Neural Network creation and visualisation ; inspired by biological neural networks present in our brain
- Train and optimise the neural network by testing numerous test cars
- Used Genetic alogrithms to train and optimise faster
